Neural Network controlled Snake 2d

I made this in High School, I never figured out how to do backpropogation, as this was done from scratch. So its a very much dependent on randomness of how the neurons weights are placed.

It will eventually by chance figure out how to stay alive forever in the given constraints. Basically making a loop without just constantly going left or right.
